            <p class="reading"> In my free time, when i am not dealing with my crazy kiddos, i am usually reading. I didnt always have a passion for reading but over the years 
                i have found it to be an escape from reality. My favorite type of books are romance and sci-fi. I prefer online books as they are more convenient 
                with my busy life but i would love one day to have a huge home libary where i can have a collection of all my favorite books.

         <p class="vacay">My husband and I love to travel. We try to go on at least 2 trips a year, one being a family trip with all my kids and the second being just him and I. 
         We have been to Jamacia, Mexico, The Cayman Islands and also other states, like Texas, Florida, and North Carolina.
